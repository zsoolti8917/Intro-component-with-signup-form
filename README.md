## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

i think i learned a lot during this project, which is my favourite so far, whene finishing it i felt really accomplished. Made the design with Mobile-first workflow which i really liked and plan to do every project this way. Tried the :placeholder pseudo class for the first time. I also learned how to make a custom error message, and show it under the input fields which i think is really cool and turned out well.
First i tought this project would take a lot of time, but i finished it in 2 hours, and i'm really happy with the result.

### Continued development

i dont plan to add anything more to this project. I think it's finished and i'm happy with it. I will continue to learn and practice with new projects.
